This GitHub Action automates the deployment of a preview environment for your
Railway project whenever a pull request is opened in your repository. It works
similarly to Vercel preview deployments. This allows you to easily review
changes in a live environment before merging.

## Features

- Deploys a new preview environment on every pull request.
- Supports custom environment variables for each deployment.
- Optionally reuses an existing preview environment for subsequent PRs.
- Optionally cleans up the environment when the PR is closed.
- Provides the deployed environmentâ€™s domain as an output for easy reference.

## Usage

Here's an example of how you can use this action in your workflow file:

```yaml
name: Deploy Preview Environment

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]

jobs:
  deploy-preview:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Railway Preview Deploy
        uses: ayungavis/railway-preview-deploy@v1.0.1
        with:
          railway_api_token: ${{ secrets.RAILWAY_API_TOKEN }}
          project_id: ${{ secrets.RAILWAY_PROJECT_ID }}
          environment_name: 'staging'
          preview_environment_name: 'pr-${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}'
          environment_variables:
            '{"DATABASE_URL": "postgres://user:pass@host/db"}'
          branch_name: ${{ github.head_ref }}
          cleanup: 'true'
```

**Inputs Breakdown:**

- `railway_api_token`: The token to authenticate your Railway API requests.
- `project_id`: The ID of your Railway project.
- `environment_name`: The base environment that the preview deployment will be
  derived from (e.g., staging).
- `preview_environment_name`: A custom name for the preview environment, which
  you can dynamically set using the PR number and commit hash.
- `environment_variables`: Optional environment variables you can set, provided
  in JSON format.
- `branch_name`: The branch from the pull request.
- `cleanup`: Whether to clean up the preview environment after the PR is closed.

## Example Workflow

The following example workflow deploys a preview environment on Railway for each
pull request:

```yaml
name: Railway Preview Deployment

  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened, closed]

permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write
  issues: write

concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}
  cancel-in-progress: true

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: ${{ github.event.action != 'closed' }}

    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
